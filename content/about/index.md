My name is Anil Battalahalli (ಅನಿಲ ಬಟ್ಟಲಹಳ್ಳಿ) <text style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: #808080;"><small>(he/they)</small></text>. I graduated from the [University of Michigan – Ann Arbor](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) with an Applied Statistics Master’s, and I am currently a statistician at [Westat](https://www.westat.com).

At the graduate school, I worked as a Graduate Student Research Assistant (GSRA) for the Data Science for Dynamic Intervention Decision-making Center (d3c), a research center at the Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan. At d3c I worked on developing statistical computational tools for clustered Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials (SMART).

 I am currently continuing my work on the development of a multilevel approach for analyzing data that arises from a clustered SMART at d3c.

I also like building electronic circuits, robots, and embedded systems projects to automate absolutely useless things. I have started several startups right from my high school times in robotics, industrial automation, IoT, etc. None of them really took off, but you might often catch me throwing the “it was a learning opportunity and I don’t regret it” mantra to cope.

I’m proficient in Python and R, and I’m trying to learn Julia. I also do machine learning, NLP, deep learning, <** insert other tech buzzwords **>.

Apart from the nerd stuff, I love producing electronic music. I am learning music production with FL Studio 20 (DAW) and Serum (Sound Design). I do film photography and develop B&W and C-41 color film at home. I also did Ballroom Dancing at the Umich Ballroom Dance Team for a year.
