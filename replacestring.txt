The simulation discussed above is implemented in R. For each case, the same samples are used, which are drawn from the distribution with the true parameters using Accept-Reject sampling. We generate 355 samples from the distribution with the true parameters, $\alpha=2.2$, $\lambda=0.3$, and $\xmin=1.1$, and use the same for inference in the three cases discussed above. In each of the three cases, the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm was used to draw 1000 samples ${\boldsymbol{\phi}^{[1]}, \boldsymbol{\phi}^{[2]} \dots \boldsymbol{\phi}^{[1000]}}$ from the posterior, and $\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}} = \text{argmax}_{\boldsymbol{\phi}} \ p(\boldphi \ | \ \mathcal{D})$ is calculated, where, $\mathcal{D}$ is the sample generated from the distribution with known true parameters. This is repeated 100 times to calculate the estimate ($\hat{\boldsymbol{\phi}}$) at each iteration.
